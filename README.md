# Frosty utility #
KAG-IRC bridge for easy server moderation. Derived from the utility used by the Frost Trunk server.

## What is it? ##
Frosty is a unique script designed for KAG servers allowing users to interact with an IRC channel from in-game, and vice versa. This allows for easy moderation as players can call an admin quickly if a situation gets out of hand, and admins can interact with players (kick, ban, freeze etc.) directly from the IRC channel.
